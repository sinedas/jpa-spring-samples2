Preface
---
What is jpa-sping-samples. In my job I was doing presentation about JPA. It covered such aspects as
persistence mapping, associations, inheritance strategies, entity livecycle, jpql queries. To present
this themes I needed some working integration tests. Spring is used for dependency injection and for
transactions management. Hibernate is used as JPA implementation.

And initial samples project born. Later I did some changes and decided to move code to github.
